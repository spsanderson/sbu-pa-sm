# Purpose

The purpose of this document is to illustrate time series analysis and forecasting. We will use a simulated dataset to analyze things like visits, discharges and payments. To perform these analyses we will be following the `modeltime` workflow. This report will be broken down into sections that follow that same workflow.

# Data

Lets take a look at our data and see what it has.

```{r data_view}
df_tbl %>%
  glimpse()
